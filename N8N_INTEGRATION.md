# n8n Integration Notes

## What exists now

The exported workflow in this folder:

- reads pending rows from Google Sheets
- normalizes `company_name` and `time_period_days`
- searches via Tavily
- validates documents
- saves validated documents to Google Drive as an Excel file
- writes the final memo back into the spreadsheet

## Why the dashboard cannot call it directly yet

The first node is still `manualTrigger`, so there is no HTTP endpoint for the dashboard to hit.

## Required production change

Replace the manual start with a `Webhook` trigger and return JSON at the end.

Until this is done, the dashboard can only run in mock/preview mode.

## Recommended webhook input contract

```json
{
  "company_name": "Chevron",
  "company_domain": "chevron.com",
  "sec_cik": "93410",
  "time_period_days": 14,
  "time_period_label": "14 days"
}
```

## Recommended webhook response contract

```json
{
  "run_id": "chevron_2026-04-20_14d_101",
  "generated_at": "2026-04-20T18:30:00.000Z",
  "final_one_pager": "One page memo text here",
  "excel_file_name": "Chevron_validated_documents_2026-04-20.xlsx",
  "validated_sources": [
    {
      "title": "Recent SEC filing for Chevron Corporation",
      "url": "https://www.sec.gov/...",
      "source_class": "official",
      "source_domain": "sec.gov",
      "actual_doc_date": "2026-04-18",
      "validation_status": "accepted",
      "entity_confidence": 0.94
    }
  ]
}
```

## Minimum n8n changes

1. Add a `Webhook` node at the start.
2. Set the webhook method to `POST`.
3. Set the webhook path to something stable, for example `csis-company-memo`.
4. Set the response mode to use a `Respond to Webhook` node.
5. Map webhook JSON fields into the same shape used by `Normalize Inputs`.
6. Connect the `Webhook` node directly into `Normalize Inputs`.
7. Remove or bypass the old `manualTrigger`, `Get pending requests`, and `Loop Over Requests` path for dashboard runs.
8. Keep the existing search, validation, Excel, and memo logic.
9. After `Validate Dates and Company Match`, aggregate the accepted docs into a `validated_sources` array.
10. After `Parse Final Strategist Output`, merge the memo output with `validated_sources`.
11. End with `Respond to Webhook`.

The final `Respond to Webhook` body should be JSON matching this shape:

```json
{
  "run_id": "={{ $('Normalize Inputs').item.json.run_id }}",
  "generated_at": "={{ $now }}",
  "final_one_pager": "={{ $json.final_one_pager }}",
  "excel_file_name": "={{ $('Normalize Inputs').item.json.company_name }}_validated_documents_{{ $now.toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd') }}.xlsx",
  "validated_sources": "={{ $json.validated_sources }}"
}
```

## Dashboard connection options

### Recommended: backend mode

Use this when the webhook requires auth or when the dashboard will be deployed publicly.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Set `WORKFLOW_MODE=webhook`.
3. Set `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` to the production n8n webhook URL.
4. Run `node server.js`.
5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

### Quick local file mode

Use this only for private/local testing.

1. Open `public/config.js`.
2. Set `n8nWebhookUrl` to the production n8n webhook URL.
3. Open `public/index.html`.
4. The status chip should say `Workflow Mode: Direct n8n webhook`.

If it still says `File preview`, no n8n webhook URL is configured.

## Recommended response fields for the dashboard

- `run_id`
- `generated_at`
- `final_one_pager`
- `validated_sources`
- `excel_file_name`

If you keep the current Google Sheets append step, that is fine, but the dashboard still needs the JSON response above so it can render results immediately.
